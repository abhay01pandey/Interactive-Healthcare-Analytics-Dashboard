# Interactive Healthcare Analytics Dashboard
This project features a dynamic data analytics dashboard built to provide key insights into patient health data. By visualizing critical health metrics, risk factors, and demographic information, this dashboard enables healthcare professionals and administrators to identify trends, allocate resources effectively, and develop targeted health initiatives. The goal is to transform complex medical data into clear, actionable intelligence that improves patient outcomes and optimizes healthcare delivery.
# Project Overview
Situated with a need to better understand patient demographics and health risks, the Task was to create a comprehensive dashboard. Action was taken by cleaning, structuring, and visualizing patient data to highlight key health indicators and risk factors. The Result is a user-friendly and interactive tool that allows for a deep dive into patient health, enabling proactive and data-informed healthcare management.
# Key Features
 * Patient Demographics: Provides a quick overview of the total patient count, with filters for gender and age groups.
 * Health Risk Analysis: Identifies the number of patients with specific risk factors, such as smoking habits and heart health.
 * Disease & Condition Tracking: Monitors the percentage of patients with a history of heart attacks and strokes.
 * Demographic Insights: Breaks down patient data by race, including overweight statistics.
 * Occupational Health: Compares average weight based on gender and whether patients are overweight, categorized by occupation.
# Key Insights
 * Out of 2004 total patients, a small but significant percentage (3.09%) have a history of heart attacks.
 * A notable group of 26 patients have a high health risk due to smoking habits.
 * The age groups of 40-49 and 50-59 have the highest number of patients with high and moderate health risks.
 * The data shows a disproportionately high number of overweight patients from the Chinese race compared to others.
 * The average weight of overweight male patients is 75.96, while for overweight females, it's 66.29.
 * The majority of patients' overall health status is categorized as Good or Very Good.
# Tools and Technologies
 * Microsoft Power BI (used for all data modeling and visualization)
 * DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
 * Power Query (for data cleaning and transformation)
# Real-World Application
This dashboard is a vital tool for hospitals, public health organizations, and medical research institutions. It can be used to:
 * Targeted Health Campaigns: Develop specific health programs for high-risk groups, such as those in the 40-59 age bracket.
 * Resource Allocation: Allocate resources more efficiently by identifying and prioritizing key health risks within the patient population.
 * Clinical Research: Provide a foundation for further research into correlations between race, health risks, and other demographic factors.
 * Proactive Patient Care: Enable healthcare providers to identify at-risk patients and provide preventive care before a health crisis occurs.
